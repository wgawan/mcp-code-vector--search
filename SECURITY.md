# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
- The `main` branch and the latest tagged release receive security attention. Older tags may not be patched.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please **do not** open public issues for security reports.
- Send a private report to the maintainers (via repository security advisory when available, or direct email once published).
- Include:
  - A clear description of the issue and potential impact.
  - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept.
  - Affected version/commit and environment details (OS, Python/Docker versions).
  - Suggested remediation, if known.

## Response Process
- We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible, request clarification if needed, and work on a fix or mitigation.
- Once a fix is ready, we aim to coordinate disclosure and release notes with you when possible.
- If the issue also affects dependencies, we may coordinate with their maintainers before public disclosure.
